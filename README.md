## Introduction

This study employs neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) to model energy transfer in tokamaks. By deriving diffusivity parameters from DIII-D tokamak data, the model accurately captures energy interactions between electrons and ions across core, edge, and scrape-off layers. Validated against various heating conditions, this approach demonstrates the potential of Neural ODEs to enhance tokamak simulation performance through deep learning.
